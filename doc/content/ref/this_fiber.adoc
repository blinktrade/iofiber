[source,cpp]
----
class fiber::this_fiber;
----

To have access to a `this_fiber` object, just `spawn()` a fiber and an object of
this type will be created for you. You can copy and pass it around freely to
other functions as you wish, but you should only use its methods within the
fiber context (i.e. within the fiber execution stack) that created it.

IMPORTANT: `fiber` is a typedef for
`basic_fiber<boost::asio::io_context::strand>`. `Strand` below will refer to the
template argument of the instantiation used.

== Member-functions

=== `operator[]()`

[source,cpp]
----
this_fiber operator[](boost::system::error_code& ec) const;
----

Will return a new `this_fiber` object which will fill `ec` instead throwing an
exception when used as a completion token argument for `async_*` functions.

Example:

[source,cpp]
----
void start(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  boost::asio::steady_timer timer{this_fiber.get_executor().context()};
  timer.expires_from_now(std::chrono::seconds(1));

  boost::system::error_code ec;
  timer.async_wait(this_fiber[ec]);
  if (ec) {
    // ...
----

[[operator_call]]
=== `operator()()`

[source,cpp]
----
template<class T, class... Args>
void operator()(T& o,
                void(T::*async_fn)(
                    Args..., const basic_this_fiber<Strand>&),
                Args&&... args);
----

Set the fiber <<interrupter,`interrupter`>> variable to `o.cancel()` and calls
`(o.*async_fn)(std::forward<Args>(args)..., *this)`.

`boost::asio::error::operation_aborted` errors will be translated to
`fiber_interrupted` exceptions.

Example:

[source,cpp]
----
void start(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  boost::asio::steady_timer timer{this_fiber.get_executor().context()};
  timer.expires_from_now(std::chrono::seconds(1));

  this_fiber(timer, &boost::asio::steady_timer::async_wait);
----

=== `get_executor()`

[source,cpp]
----
Strand get_executor() const;
----

Returns the strand associated with this fiber. You can set the strand associated
with the fiber by passing the desired strand by the time you call
`spawn()`. User-code running on this fiber will always be executed through this
strand. Implementation details might or might not move the fiber through
different strands to perform some synchronization but no user code will be
called while the fiber is in a foreign strand.

=== `yield()`

[source,cpp]
----
void yield();
----

Re-schedules the fiber to be executed soon. Use this function to yield CPU-time
to other fibers if you don't want to block the thread while doing intensive CPU
work for a long period of time.

[[call]]
=== `call()`

[source,cpp]
----
template<class R, class T, class... Args>
R call(T& o, R(T::*async_fn)(Args..., const basic_this_fiber<Strand>&),
       Args&&... args);

template<class T, class... Args>
void call(T& o,
          void(T::*async_fn)(Args..., const basic_this_fiber<Strand>&),
          Args&&... args);
----

Set the fiber <<interrupter,`interrupter`>> variable to `o.cancel()` and calls
`(o.*async_fn)(std::forward<Args>(args)..., *this)`. If `R` is provided,
function will return value from `async_fn()` call.

`boost::asio::error::operation_aborted` errors will be translated to
`fiber_interrupted` exceptions.

Example:

[source,cpp]
----
void start(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  boost::asio::steady_timer timer{this_fiber.get_executor().context()};
  timer.expires_from_now(std::chrono::seconds(1));

  this_fiber.call<>(timer, &boost::asio::steady_timer::async_wait);
----

=== `{forbid,allow}_suspend()`

[source,cpp]
----
void forbid_suspend();
void allow_suspend();
----

These functions are in the same level of usefulness of an `assert()`
directive. They're only useful if there are comprehensive test cases and they
expand to no-ops if compiled with `NDEBUG`.

Still, the use of these functions may make the code more readable. And some
tools may be developed to understand these blocks and do some simple static
analysis.

A call to `forbid_suspend()` will put the fiber in the state of
_suspension-disallowed_ and any attempt to suspend the fiber while it is in this
state will call `std::abort()`.

`forbid_suspend()` may be called multiple times. A matching number of calls to
`allow_suspend()` will put the fiber out of the _suspension-disallowed_
state. You must not call `allow_suspend()` if there was no prior call to
`forbid_suspend()`.

``this_fiber``'s copy constructor will also trigger a call to `std::abort()` if
the fiber is in the `suspension-disallowed` state as the copy constructor is
only used to make calls to functions that potentially suspend and this defensive
behaviour will make you less dependant of fully comprehensive tests.

link:../assert_exclusive_strand_ref/[`assert_exclusive_strand_ref(3)`] RAII
helper.

== Member variables

[[interrupter]]
=== `interrupter`

[source,cpp]
----
std::function<void()>& interrupter;
----

When you interrupt a fiber (i.e. `fiber::interrupt()`), a generic interruption
trigger will be executed to wake-up the fiber and throw a `fiber_interrupted`
exception. However, this behaviour won't immediately cancel pending IO
requests. Suppose your fiber is suspended in the following point when an
interruption request arrives:

[source,cpp]
----
void start(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  boost::asio::steady_timer timer{this_fiber.get_executor().context()};
  timer.expires_from_now(std::chrono::seconds(1));

  try {
    timer.async_wait(this_fiber);
----

You might postpone interruption fulfilment to later by having some code like
this:

[source,cpp]
----
  } catch (const fiber_interruption&) {
    [[maybe_unused]]
    fiber::this_fiber::disable_interruption di{this_fiber};

    // some time (time != CPU time) consuming task here
----

By this point, the `timer` object is still alive and its pending request hasn't
been cancelled yet â€” it'd be automatically cancelled by letting the destructor
run.

You can fix this situation by having a custom interrupter to wake-up the fiber
when an interruption request arrives. Just assign a value to this variable right
before reaching a fiber suspension point.

NOTE: It's only useful to modify this variable for IO requests (i.e. `async_*`
functions) as the default interrupter will do fine for `this_fiber.yield()`,
`fib.join(this_fiber)` and other synchronization techniques shown here.

== Nested types

=== `disable_interruption`

Saves current interruption enabled state (and disable interruptions) on
construction and restores it on destruction. It's non-moveable and non-copyable.

See link:../../tutorial/interruption/[`interruption(7)`] for more.

=== `restore_interruption`

Temporarily reverses the effects of the `disable_interruption` object. It's
non-moveable and non-copyable.

See link:../../tutorial/interruption/[`interruption(7)`] for more.
