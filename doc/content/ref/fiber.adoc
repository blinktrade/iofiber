[source,cpp]
----
class fiber;
----

This class is a move-only handle representing a spawned fiber. It's the object
returned by `spawn()`.

`fiber` objects may also be in a state that doesn't represent any fiber (after
move-from, `detach()`, or `join()`).

WARNING: If the object represents a valid fiber, you *MUST* either call
`join(this_fiber)` or `detach()` before the destructor is run.

IMPORTANT: `fiber` is a typedef for
`basic_fiber<boost::asio::io_context::strand>`. `Strand` below will refer to the
template argument of the instantiation used.

== Member-functions

=== `joinable()`

[source,cpp]
----
bool joinable() const;
----

Checks if the fiber object identifies an active fiber of execution.

=== `join()`

[source,cpp]
----
void join(this_fiber this_fiber);

template<class Strand2>
void join(typename basic_fiber<Strand2>::this_fiber this_fiber);
----

Suspend current fiber (i.e. `this_fiber`) until the fiber identified by `*this`
finishes its execution.

Concurrently calling `join()` on the same `fiber` object from multiple fibers
results in undefined behavior.

.Preconditions

`joinable()` is `true`.

.Postconditions

`joinable()` is `false`.

.Exceptions

`fiber_interrupted` if `this_fiber` is interrupted.

NOTE: If joining process is interrupted the handle remains joinable so you may
perform the `join()` operation again (or perform other operations like
`interrupt()` and `detach()`).

=== `detach()`

[source,cpp]
----
void detach();
----

Separates the fiber of execution from the fiber object, allowing execution to
continue independently. Any allocated resources will be freed once the fiber
exits.

.Preconditions

`joinable()` is `true`.

.Postconditions

`joinable()` is `false`.

=== `interrupt()`

[source,cpp]
----
void interrupt();
----

See link:../../tutorial/interruption/[`interruption(7)`].

=== `interruption_caught()`

[source,cpp]
----
bool interruption_caught() const;
----

Check whether the fiber finished by normal means or by letting the
`fiber_interrupted` exception escape its execution stack.

See link:../../tutorial/interruption/[`interruption(7)`] for more.

.Preconditions

Fiber has been successfully joined.

== Nested types

=== `this_fiber`

See link:../this_fiber/[`this_fiber(3)`].

== Free functions

=== `context_aborted()`

[source,cpp]
----
bool context_aborted(boost::asio::io_context& ctx);
----

Check whether the context finished normally or abnormally. The context will be
terminated when you fail to `join()` or `detach()` a joinable fiber (abnormal
termination).

The context is terminated through the usual call to `ctx.stop()` in case you're
concerned. In addition, a `std::logic_error` may also be raised.
