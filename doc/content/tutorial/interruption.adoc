:_:

If a fiber is stalled waiting for some IO request that might never complete you
still can use the interruption API to stop the fiber. The fiber interruption API
was inspired by the POSIX thread cancellation API (and
Boost.Thread)footnote:[Check link:../background/[_background(7)_] for a more
comprehensive list.].

== Interrupting a fiber

If you want to interrupt a fiber, call `fiber::interrupt()`. An interruption
request will be queued for near delivery to interrupt the fiber.

The fiber will react to the interruption request when it next calls a function
that is a suspension point (or if it is currently _suspended_ whilst executing
one). If the target fiber has disabled interruption, then the interruption
request remains queued until the fiber enables interruption _and_ reaches a new
suspension point.

NOTE: The semantics are the same of a POSIX's `PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED` thread.

By default, the interruption request is delivered by throwing a
`fiber_interrupted` exception originating at the suspension point. Unless this
exception is caught inside the interrupted fiber's start-function, the stack
unwinding process (as with any other exception) causes the destructors with
automatic storage duration to be executed. Unlike other exceptions, when
`fiber_interrupted` is propagated out of fiber's start-function, this does not
cause the call to `std::terminate`; the effect is as though the fiber's
start-function has returned normally.

To avoid accidental trap of the `fiber_interrupted` exception, this class
doesn't inherit `std::exception`.

You can check whether the fiber finished by normal means or by letting the
`fiber_interrupted` exception escape its stack by using
`fiber::interruption_caught()` (after joining it). If the `fiber_interrupted`
exception escaped the stack, then `fiber::interruption_caught()` will return
`true`.

NOTE: `fiber::interruption_caught()` exposes the information that POSIX
otherwise offers through `PTHREAD_CANCELED`.

== Reacting to interruption requests

When a fiber is interrupted and reaches a suspension point, a
`fiber_interrupted` exception will be throw and you'll be unable to perform any
operation that would otherwise suspend the fiber.

[NOTE]
====
It is safe to catch and swallow the `fiber_interrupted` exception using
try-catch blocks. If you do this, `interruption_caught()` will return
`false`.

However, catching the `fiber_interrupted` exception is not enough to disable
interruptions and perform operations abstracted with suspending functions. As
soon as you call the suspending function within the catch block, another
`fiber_interrupted` exception will be throw (operation will not even start for
what it is worth).
====

=== Disabling interruptions

If you wish to temporarily disable interruptions and stay capable of using
suspending functions, just instantiate an object of the class
`fiber::this_fiber::disable_interruption`. Objects of this class disable
interruption for the fiber that created them on construction, and restore the
interruption state to whatever it was before on destruction:

[source,cpp]
----
void f(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  // interruption enabled here
  {
    fiber::this_fiber::disable_interruption di{this_fiber};
    // interruption disabled
    {
      fiber::this_fiber::disable_interruption di2{this_fiber};
      // interruption still disabled
    } // di2 destroyed, interruption state restored
    // interruption still disabled
  } // di destroyed, interruption state restored
  // interruption now enabled
}
----

The effects of an instance of `fiber::this_fiber::disable_interruption` can be
temporarily reversed by constructing an instance of
`fiber::this_fiber::restore_interruption`, passing in the
`fiber::this_fiber::disable_interruption` object in question. This will restore
the interruption state to what it was when the
`fiber::this_fiber::disable_interruption` object was constructed, and then
disable interruption again when the `fiber::this_fiber::restore_interruption`
object is destroyed.

[source,cpp]
----
void g(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  // interruption enabled here
  {
    fiber::this_fiber::disable_interruption di{this_fiber};
    // interruption disabled
    {
      fiber::this_fiber::restore_interruption ri{di};
      // interruption now enabled
    } // ri destroyed, interruption disable again
  } // di destroyed, interruption state restored
  // interruption now enabled
}
----

NOTE: This provides the functionality that POSIX otherwise offers through
`pthread_setcancelstate()`.

=== `async_*` functions

When a fiber is interrupted at an `async_*` function, the underlying IO request
isn't cancelled immediately. Usually, this is not a problem because in code
pieces like this (which should be most of the code out there)...

[source,cpp]
----
void start(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  boost::asio::steady_timer timer{this_fiber.get_executor().context()};
  timer.expires_from_now(std::chrono::seconds(1));

  boost::system::error_code ec;
  timer.async_wait(this_fiber[ec]);
  // ...
}
----

...if the fiber is interrupted, stack unwinding will play on and destruct the
underlying IO objects causing the operations to be aborted.

However, this behaviour is less than ideal and for this reason you can customize
the interrupter by filling the `this_fiber.interrupter` variable:

[source,cpp]
----
void start(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  boost::asio::steady_timer timer{this_fiber.get_executor().context()};
  timer.expires_from_now(std::chrono::seconds(1));

  this_fiber.interrupter = [&timer]() { timer.cancel(); };

  boost::system::error_code ec;
  timer.async_wait(this_fiber[ec]);
  // ...
}
----

Unfortunately you still have to translate the
`boost::asio::error::operation_aborted` error to a `fiber_interrupted` exception
in this example on the suspension-site if you want to
`fiber::interruption_caught()` to report exit reason correctly. To simplify
matters further, the following syntax sugar is provided:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <trial/iofiber/interrupter/asio/basic_waitable_timer.hpp>

void start(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  boost::asio::steady_timer timer{this_fiber.get_executor().context()};
  timer.expires_from_now(std::chrono::seconds(1));

  boost::system::error_code ec;
  timer.async_wait(this_fiber[ec].with_intr(timer));
  // ...
}
----

[NOTE]

== Example

When you do operations involving buffers, it's a common requirement that you
keep the buffer accessible until the operation completes.

[source,cpp]
----
void start(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  // ...

  boost::system::error_code ec;
  BufferType buf;
  boost::asio::async_read(socket, buf, this_fiber[ec]);
  // ...
}
----

If you rely on the default (no) interrupter (as in the example), then you have a
problem. `buf` might be destroyed due to stack unwinding on `fiber_interrupted`
while the `async_read()` operation is in progress.

The solution is easy. Teach IOFiber how to interrupt the operation so the fiber
wakeup (to throw `fiber_interrupted`) synchronizes with the cancellation of the
underlying operation:

[source,cpp]
----
void start(fiber::this_fiber this_fiber)
{
  // ...

  // Must handle `operation_aborted` explicitly later
  this_fiber.interrupter = [&socket]() { socket.cancel(); };

  boost::system::error_code ec;
  BufferType buf;
  boost::asio::async_read(socket, buf, this_fiber[ec]);
  // ...
}
----
====

`with_intr()` will set `this_fiber.interrupter` and return a new token for the
`async_*` operation. The interrupter is selected based on a trait mechanism —
`interrupter_for`. This is the specialization for `boost::asio::steady_timer`:

[source,cpp]
----
template<class Clock, class WaitTraits, class Executor>
struct interrupter_for<
  boost::asio::basic_waitable_timer<Clock, WaitTraits, Executor>>
{
  // Called within `with_intr()` before operation begins
  template<class T>
  static void assign(
    T this_fiber,
    boost::asio::basic_waitable_timer<Clock, WaitTraits, Executor>& timer)
  {
    this_fiber.interrupter = [&timer]() { timer.cancel(); };
  }

  // Called after result is ready (just before control goes back to the user)
  template<class T, class... Args>
  static void on_result(T this_fiber, boost::system::error_code& ec,
                        Args&...)
  {
    if (ec == boost::asio::error::operation_aborted)
      throw trial::iofiber::fiber_interrupted();
  }
};
----

`on_result()` will be called on the fiber stack just before the result is
converted back to user-consumption (e.g. error codes will be converted to
exceptions if user has not used the `this_fiber[ec]` syntax).  Arguments are
passed to the trait by _non-const ref_ and you can mutate them before delivery
to the user (e.g. if you clear the error code object, no exception will be
thrown).

You may specialize this trait for any object (or sequence of objects). They will
be forwarded from the call to `with_intr()` to `assign()`. It is expected that
library providers specialize it for their IO objects so you don't have to worry.
Separate headers in this library will specialize this trait for Boost/ASIO IO
objects.

IMPORTANT: If you want to force the use of this safer `with_intr()` syntax and
forbid plain `this_fiber` to work as a completion token, just define
`TRIAL_IOFIBER_DISABLE_DEFAULT_INTERRUPTER`.

== Suspension points

Fibers are scheduled cooperatively which means that CPU time is only transferred
from one fiber to the next at defined suspension points. The suspension points
for fibers are:

* Boost.Asio's `async_*` functions.
* `this_fiber.yield()`.
* `fiber::join(this_fiber)`.

Any functions that are compositions of these functions will also be functions
that serve as suspension points and might throw `fiber_interrupted`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
`mutex::lock()` is a suspension point, but it is not an interruption point. This
is by-design. The primary problem solved by interruption requests is freeing
fibers stalled in operations that might never finish, not “recovering” fibers on
a deadlock. Code your programs correctly.

On the other hand, `condition_variable::wait()` might be associated with
external events so it *is* an interruption point. Refer to its documentation for
more details.

It follows POSIX design.
====

Use `this_fiber.yield()` if you want to create a suspension point so that a
fiber that is otherwise executing code that contains no suspension points will
respond to an interruption request.

[NOTE]
====
Although `this_fiber.yield()` is semantically closer to POSIX's `sched_yield()`,
you can use it to achieve the effects of POSIX's `pthread_testcancel()`.

It diverges from POSIX because the {cpp} programmer already has to deal with
RAII and “unexpected” exceptions won't fail to clean resources as it'd happen to
the C user who “forgot” to manage resources using `pthread_cleanup_push()`.
====

IMPORTANT: `fiber::interrupt()` is guaranteed to *NOT* be an interruption point.
